# first-aid-CPR-awareness
A repository to share knowledge on the importance of First Aid and CPR training
In a world full of uncertainties, having the ability to respond to emergencies is a superpower. Whether itâ€™s a workplace accident, a car crash, or a sudden cardiac arrest at home, knowing First Aid and CPR can save lives. At [Give First Aid Australia](https://www.givefirstaid.au/)), weâ€™re dedicated to empowering individuals and organizations with these life-saving skills through affordable and comprehensive training programs.

The Growing Need for First Aid and CPR Training
Every year, thousands of lives are lost because immediate help wasnâ€™t available during critical moments. According to global statistics, over 80% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur at home, and survival rates increase drastically when CPR is administered promptly. First Aid skills go beyond emergenciesâ€”they help you tackle injuries, burns, or allergic reactions before professional medical help arrives.
